# React Performance Labs

## Running Examples

This project includes multiple React examples demonstrating performance optimization techniques with. To switch between examples:

```bash
npm run examples
```

This will launch an interactive menu where you can:

- Use **↑↓ arrow keys** to navigate through available examples
- Press **Enter** to select an example
- Press **Ctrl+C** or **Esc** to quit
